# Event storming
In the realm of software engineering, the "Clearview" project posed a challenge to develop an advanced system for a transparent hiring process. This undertaking necessitated careful planning and the use of event-storming methodology to effectively understand and design a system that aligns with actual needs and workflows. Below, we outline the technical journey of the "Clearview" project, detailing the phases of event-storming while emphasizing the technical aspects and challenges encountered.

## 1. Gathering events and sequencing
The initial step involved gathering key events essential for the operation of the "Clearview" system.The events were arranged chronologically to grasp the flow of data and interactions within the system. This sequence illuminated the temporal dependencies between events and their impact on both system operations and the patient care process. The following events were identified:

- **Candidate registered**: A new candidate is added to the system, marking the beginning of their job search journey.
- **resume uploaded**: The candidate uploads their resume to the system.
- **resume parsed**: The patient's device is paired with a gateway to facilitate the transmission of sensor data.
- **resume updated**: Sensors attached to the patient collect health data.
- **resume previewed**: The collected sensor data is sent from the patient's device to the system for processing.
- **resume submitted**: The system receives sensor data transmitted from the patient's device.
- **job applied**: Sensor data is logged and stored in the system's database for future reference and analysis.
- **ai resume recieved**: The system receives sensor data transmitted from the patient's device.
- **resume tips showed**: Sensor data is logged and stored in the system's database for future reference and analysis.
- **profile anonimized**: The sensor data is saved in a structured format in the system's database.
- **story created**: The system analyzes the received sensor data to assess the patient's vital signs.
- **job description recieved**: The system identifies an issue or anomaly in the patient's vital signs or sensor data.
- **job matched**: An alert is generated and sent to the medical staff if an issue is detected in the patient's health data.
- **employer registered**: A snapshot of the current sensor data and patient status is created for quick review.
- **company details filled**: The generated snapshot is uploaded to the system for access by the medical staff.
- **job posting fetched**: A patient is removed from the system, ending their health monitoring session.
- **matching profile fetched**: A failure is detected in one of the sensors or the patient's device.
- **matching profile displayed**: Push notifications are sent to the nurse's station or device to alert them of new data or issues.
- **profile viewed**: Push notifications are sent to mobile devices, alerting staff or patients about important updates or issues.
- **employer payment completed**: Indicates that a nurse has viewed the alert generated by the system.
- **invoice created**: Medical staff reviews the historical data of a patient's health records.
- **profile unlocked**: Data that is older than 24 hours is archived for long-term storage.
- **mark candidate as hired**: Data that is deemed unnecessary or non-critical is deleted after 24 hours to maintain data efficiency and privacy.
- **mark candidate as not hired**: The system's software is updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, or improve performance.
- **survey taken**: The system's software is updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, or improve performance.
- **admin registered**: Push notifications are sent to the nurse's station or device to alert them of new data or issues.
- **employer listed**: Push notifications are sent to mobile devices, alerting staff or patients about important updates or issues.
- **candidate listed**: Indicates that a nurse has viewed the alert generated by the system.
- **analytics data generated**: Medical staff reviews the historical data of a patient's health records.
- **report generated**: Data that is older than 24 hours is archived for long-term storage.

## 2. Adding actors and commands
This phase defined the actors and commands necessary for user interaction with the system and event processing. Example commands include:


**user role**:
- candidate - frontline healthcare providers responsible for the setup of patient monitoring devices, ongoing monitoring, and responding to system-generated alerts and notifications.
- employer - healthcare providers, including doctors and specialists, use the system for detailed analysis of patient health data and create snapshot data.
- admin - healthcare providers, including doctors and specialists, use the system for detailed analysis of patient health data and create snapshot data.

**commands**:
- upload data - sets or adjusts the intervals at which sensor data is read or updates are sent to healthcare providers, customizable to patient needs and condition severity.
- read data - initiates the transfer of patient data from sensors to the central system for analysis, or between healthcare systems, for comprehensive patient care management.
- update data - initiates the transfer of patient data from sensors to the central system for analysis, or between healthcare systems, for comprehensive patient care management.
- initiate payment - initiates the transfer of patient data from sensors to the central system for analysis, or between healthcare systems, for comprehensive patient care management.
- create invioice - initiates the transfer of patient data from sensors to the central system for analysis, or between healthcare systems, for comprehensive patient care management.
- generate analytics - initiates the transfer of patient data from sensors to the central system for analysis, or between healthcare systems, for comprehensive patient care management.

## 3. Grouping events
Events were grouped according to functionality or business processes, e.g., patient registration, data monitoring, and health status analysis. This grouping helped us understand the system's modular nature and facilitated the design of bounded context.

In this phase, bounded contexts:
1. Account
- manages candidates,employers,admin
- set their roles.
- Store their  profile data
- Hold company details

2. Resume Processing
- Parse resume
- Send to AI Module
- Anonimaize data
- Ensure secure profile data
- ensure redily available for report and analysis

3. Job Matching
- Find matching jobs for candidates
- Find matching candidate for employer

4. Report
- Process and show candidates, Employer details
- Fetch and Show resume data

5. Hiring
- Hire Candidates
- Mark candidates hiring
- Mark Job status

6. Batch process
- Fet job data in a specific time interval
