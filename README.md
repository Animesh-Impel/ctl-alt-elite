## Architecture Characteristics
To ensure a successful system implementation, it's vital to prioritize key architecture characteristics. These elements guarantee reliability, availability, and responsiveness, delivering a seamless user experience.


*Figure: Architecture Characteristics*

## Top 3 Characteristics
### Scalability
 Scalability allows the system to accommodate a growing user base and increased data volume, ensuring that Road Warrior can scale its services as it gains more users.
### Performance
 Performance optimization is critical to meet the specified response times and deliver real-time travel updates quickly and efficiently.
### Availability
"99.99% uptime" is a High availability, with a maximum of 5 minutes per month of unplanned downtime, is essential to ensure travelers can access their reservations and updates reliably.

## Implicit Characteristics
### Feasibility (Cost/Time)
Achieving rapid time-to-market while managing development costs is a feasible goal with the selected "mini-services" architecture.
### Security
Implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms is vital to safeguard traveler information and data integrity. Also storing the PII data like trip information needs to be protected and handle properly due to compliance like GDPR. 
Token-based authentication (JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC) must safeguard all API access. Additional considerations encompass encrypting data at rest and during transmission, ensuring secure credential management, effectively managing sessions, implementing refresh tokens for applications, and integrating IAM for enhanced security.
### Maintainability
Ensuring clean code, documentation, and knowledge sharing within the development team are essential for long-term system maintainability.
### Observability
Implementing comprehensive monitoring and observability solutions enables efficient tracking of system performance and early issue detection for proactive problem-solving.

## Other Characteristics

## Architecture Approach
### Architecture Style

*Figure: Architecture Style*

Based on the architecture charetrisctis we prefer to use the microservices based style.

#### Options for service granularity



### Scalability

- **Granular Scaling**: Mini-services allow for granular scaling of specific parts of the application to meet varying workloads efficiently.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Scalability ensures optimal resource usage, preventing over-provisioning and reducing operational costs.
- **Seamless Growth**: The architecture facilitates the seamless growth of the system as user numbers and data volume increase over time.

### Availability

- **Independent Deployment**: The architecture's emphasis on independent deployment contributes to high availability. If one mini-service experiences issues or requires maintenance, it does not necessarily impact the availability of other services.
- **Cluster setup with DR Plan**: All components must be capable of operating in cluster mode and accommodating horizontal scalability. Additionally, the application should be deployable in various regions to address Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP) requirements, ensuring compliance with a 99.99% Service Level Agreement (SLA).
- **Robust Testing and CI/CD**: The inclusion of robust testing and CI/CD practices ensures that new updates can be quickly and reliably deployed, minimizing the likelihood of extended downtime.

![AWS Infrastructure Architecture](/Diagrams/aws-infra-architecture.png)
*Figure:* AWS Infrastructure Architecture  
#### Regions 
 Regions are geographic areas that contain data centers. Also helps to enable DR/BCP.  
#### Availability Zones 
Within each region, indicate the availability zones (AZs) that your resources span. AZs are physically separate data centers with redundant power, cooling, and networking.  
#### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)  
Virtual Private Cloud(s) in use. A VPC provides a private network for your AWS resources.  
####  Subnets    
Subnets are subdivisions of your VPC and can be public or private.  
#### EC2 Instances    
EC2 instances (virtual servers) within your subnets. Specify their instance types and roles (e.g., web server, database server). 
#### RDS (Relational Database Service)    
PostgreSQL used as database engines, storage, and replication if applicable. 
Can enable read replica and table partition for higher scalablity   
#### Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)    
It simplifies the process of processing and analyzing vast amounts of data using popular frameworks like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, and more.
We use combination of Flink and EMR for batch processing
#### AWS Amplify   
Simplifies the process of building full-stack web and mobile applications.
It provides developers with a set of libraries, a command-line interface (CLI), and a set of back-end services to streamline the development and deployment of cloud-powered applications.  
#### S3 Buckets  
Represent Amazon S3 buckets for object storage. 
Indicate if they are used for static assets, backups, or other purposes.  
 Additionally, S3 serves as a repository for batch process job details and processed data. 
 It can also function as a data lake, housing report data and trip data for future analytical purposes.
#### Application Load Balancers  
Application Load Balancers for distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances or containers. 
Our Krakend API Gatway uses ALB for providing public access  
 
#### CloudWatch and Metrics 
Include CloudWatch for monitoring and metrics collection. Show how it integrates with other services.
